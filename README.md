ElliPy
======
**ElliPy (EP)** package for Python is a standalone set of easy-to-use configurable Python routines and classes to perform
operations with ellipsoids and hyperplanes of arbitrary dimensions. It computes the external and internal 
ellipsoidal approximations of geometric (Minkowski) sums and differences of ellipsoids, intersections of 
ellipsoids and intersections of ellipsoids with halfspaces and polytopes; distances between ellipsoids, 
between ellipsoids and hyperplanes, between ellipsoids and polytopes; and projections onto given subspaces.

Ellipsoidal methods are used to compute forward and backward reach sets of continuous- and discrete-time 
piecewise affine systems. Forward and backward reach sets can be also computed for piecewise linear systems 
ith disturbances. It can be verified if computed reach sets intersect with given ellipsoids, hyperplanes, 
or polytopes.
